The ultracold regime extends toward molecules on many fronts [1]. Several bialkali molecules are avail- able [2–4] and others are under development. Creative and carefully engineered laser cooling strategies are tack- ling certain nearly vibrationally diagonal molecules [5– 9]. A plethora of non-optical cooling strategies have suc- ceeded to greater or lesser extents on other molecules [10– 14]. All of these molecules will require secondary strate- gies like evaporation or sympathetic cooling to make fur- ther gains in phase space density. They also may face a familiar challenge: spin flip loss near the zero of a mag- netic trap, but dramatically enhanced for many doubly dipolar molecules due to their internal spin dynamics in mixed electric and magnetic fields.The knowledge of spin flips or Majorana hops as an eventual trap lifetime limit predates the very first mag- netic trapping of neutrals [15]. Spin flips were directly observed near 10 μK and overcome in the TOP trap [16], and soon later with a plugged dipole trap [17], famously enabling the first Bose-Einstein condensates. We observe spin-flips in a 170 mK OH sample, four orders of mag- nitude higher in temperature compared with the atomic case. We observe this and tune it in our new dual mag- netic and electric quadrupole trap, but it also applies to our previous geometry [18], a 3D permanent magnet quadrupole trap, when homogeneous electric field is ap- plied. We use this simpler geometry, detailed in panels (d) and (e) of fig. 1, as our starting point to explain the internal spin-dynamics that lead to the spin-flip loss. We then explain our new trapping geometry and how it achieves tunable removal of spin-flip loss. The internal spin-dynamics are applicable to Hund’s case A molecules and also to Hund’s case B to a lesser extent.The internal spin-dynamics that lead to this enhanced spin-flip loss are subtle, having eluded three previous in- vestigations. In [21] the analogues of atomic spin-flip loss for molecules in mixed fields were investigated, and our focus case, a magnetic quadrupole trap for OH molecules with superposed electric field, was specifically addressed. It was concluded that no significant loss enhancement due to electric field should be evident. While this is true for the approximate 2Π1/2 Hamiltonian used in that study,FIG. 1.OH’s J = 3/2 ground manifold. An opposite parity manifold sits100 mK below.

Motivated by suggestions of intriguing collisional physics, in [19] E-field induced collisions were studied. Although an effort was made to deconvolve spin-flip loss, the mag- nitudes were underestimated. [22] Finally, in [23] it was correctly noted that Hund’s case A molecules maintain a quantization axis in mixed fields. In fact the states of the molecule align with one of two quantization axes- ei- ther the vector sum or the vector difference of the dipole moment weighted electric and magnetic fields. It was asserted that this would maintain quantization near theThe blocking effect. (a), four Zeeman split lines in
zero of a quadrupole trap and avoid spin-flip loss. Quan- tization is maintained, but spin-flip loss is enhanced.This is actually the crux of the internal spin-dynamics that lead to loss. With only magnetic field, a molecule re- mains trapped insofar as it adiabatically follows the field direction. Near the trap center, the direction changes most rapidly, enabling loss. When electric field is added, it dominates in the trap center where the magnetic field is weakest. Quantization is maintained but the quanti- zation axis does not rotate with the magnetic field as it needs to. Further away from the trap center the molecule is then magnetically strong field seeking and is lost. The molecule ought to have switched from the vector sum quantization axis to the vector difference quantization axis, so as to remain doubly weak field seeking despite the change in relative orientation of the fields.In terms of energies, this manifests as an unusually narrow Zeeman splitting in the region where the relative field orientation changes, i.e. where the fields are orthog- onal. In our focus case this occurs in a plane through the trap center, but generally it is always a 2D region since it is a level set of the continuous scalar φ=E·B. Inthe subset of this plane where μBB << dEE, the Zeeman effect is not linear but cubic. We call this “blocking”, see fig. 1, and we say that the E-field blocks the Zeeman effect from linear to cubic. Eventually the Zeeman ef- fect overcomes the blocking and returns to linear when dE E ≈ μB B. The Stark effect is not blocked by the Zeeman thanks to lambda doubling, which gives a large fixed energy barrier to electric field misalignment.This observation allows us to develop a scaling law for the enhancement. For a given trap strength and sam- ple temperature, there is a characteristic energy split- ting κ below which spin-flips can occur, calculated from the Landau-Zener formula. In our case κ = 5 MHz. As shown in panel (e) of fig. 1, E-field widens the κ valued energy contour near the trap zero, greatly in- creasing the flux through this region. We can series ex- pand the exact eigenenergies of OH to find HE⊥B(B) ≈ (μBB)3∆2/(dEE)4, ∆ the lambda doubling term. Solv- ing for B when HE⊥B(B) = κ and dividing by the E = 0 case gives the flux enhancement factor ν = (dEE/√κ∆)8/3. So E-fields beyond √κ∆ lead to almost cubic enhancements in spin-flip loss. For other Hund’s case A molecules, similar expressions can be derived. The order of the blocked Zeeman effect is 2J, so that only J = 1/2 molecules are immune, but these are not magnetically trappable due to their vanishing g-factor. For Hund’s case B the enhanced loss region is restricted to the trap energy regime where γ the spin-rotation cou- pling dominates. This can still be significant, for example γ = 75 MHz for SrF [24].We can be more quantitative by integrating the veloc- ity distribution and the flux through the plane, account- ing for the velocity dependent Landau-Zener probability, Table.

Those results will thus require reinter- pretation considering this effect [26]. With the goal of μK temperatures and below, it is clear spin-flip loss must be addressed.We can sum up with a simple strategy: avoid μBB <Dual quadrupole trap embedded in Stark Deceler-

One way to obey this is to trap with E-field and superpose B-field. Although the lambda dou- blet prevents flips in this configuration, it also weakens the trap considerably, undesirable for maintaining large trap frequencies at low temperatures. Another option is to trap with both fields and keep zeros overlapped. This prevents spin-flip loss enhancement, but does not remove it entirely. It is also susceptible to misalignment induced spin-flip loss. A superposed magnetic quadrupole and electric hexapole has been realized for OH [27]. Although the use of only a single field would avoid spin-flip loss, any experiment which aims to make use of the doubly dipolar nature of molecules cannot accept this compromise.Seeking to remove the loss entirely but without trap depth or trap gradient sacrifice, we use a pair of 2D quadrupole traps, one magnetic and the other electric, with orthogonal axes. We achieve these fields with a ge- ometry that matches our Stark decelerator [13], as shown in fig. 2. This approach is similar to the Ioffe-Pritchard strategy [28], where a 2D quadrupole is combined with an axial dipole trap. Axial and radial trapping interfere, resulting in significantly lower trap depths than the 3D quadrupole. We thwart this interference by using electric field for the third direction. This geometry has E ⊥ B along both the x−z and y−z planes, with μBB < dEE in a large cylinder surrounding the z-axis. However, by adding magnetic field along the zero axis of the magnetic quadrupole with external bias coils, a fully tunable sce- nario emerges.Bcoil allows a full tuning from the fast 200 s−1 loss trace recorded in Panel (b) of Fig. 4 to complete re- moval. It does this by morphing the E ⊥ B surface from a pair of planes into a hyperbolic sheet which deviates spatially from the magnetic field minimum along the z- axis. Thanks to this deviation, for suitable magnitude ofFIG. 4.density modulated trace, and an extended time trace. (b) At the fixed time 30ms, population as a function of pin transla- tion and bias field.Bcoil, μBB < dEE can be avoided. In fig. 3, the surfaces where E ⊥ B are colored wherever the splitting there is below the hopping threshold κ. Note how Bcoil tunes the proximity of the loss regions to zero. The loss regions are always visible, but they are tuned so far from the trap center that molecules accessing them have already escaped the trap.As a further confirmation of our E ⊥ B and μBB < dEE model of the loss, we translate our magnetic pins in their mounts to alter the surface where E ⊥ B and com- pare experimental data against our expectations. The data are shown in fig. 4. Qualitatively, this translation serves to disrupt the otherwise perfectly 2D magnetic quadrupole by adding a small trapping field B⃗ ∝ B′zzˆ(a) Time traces for aligned pins at two bias fields, a
along the z-axis. This means that Bcoil no longer directly tunes the minimum magnetic field in the trap. Instead, Bcoil must first overcome the slight trapping field along the z-axis, translating a point of zero field along the z axis and eventually out of the trap. The point of zero field disrupts the previously hyperbolic E ⊥ B surface, causing it to twist and intersect the z-axis near the mag- netic zero. This intersection point has μB B << dE E except when aligned with the trap center, where E also goes to zero. This means that without any bias field, the loss should actually be a local minimum; as the field is increased in either direction the loss should first worsen and then improve when the zero leaves the trap. This qualitative explanation correctly predicts the observed double well structure.Quantitatively, we fit the family of curves shown in fig. 4 by performing an integration of molecule flux weighted by Landau-Zener probability and Maxwell- Boltzmann population density over the strangely twisted hyperbola of E ⊥ B. The computation is performed in COMSOL Multiphysics, accounting for the expected magnetic and electric fields from the trapping geometry with various offsets and with cloud temperature as the only free parameter [29]. The fit temperature is approxi- mately 170 mK. The asymmetry of the curves about the Bcoil = 0 axis comes from a slight shift of the electric quadrupole minimum caused by an intentional bending of the last pin pair to increase fluorescence collection. This offset is not a free parameter in the model, it is directly included according to the measured bending ap- plied to the pins. The fitted temperature is larger than expected from our simulations of the geometry, despite the known defocusing and reflection losses that accom- pany pulsed decelerators at low speeds [30]. This may be related to micro-discharges on the surfaces of the mag- netic pins during the final deceleration pulse. The mag- netic pins are not currently polished as well as the rest of the decelerator, but this is not a fundamental limitation and could be overcome by diamond turning of the nickel plating on the pins or some other polishing strategy.Another way to validate our understanding of molec- ular spin-flip loss in our dual quadrupole trap would be to confirm that the location of the loss is indeed pushed away from the trap center with increasing Bcoil as shown in fig. 3. We achieve this with a Zeeman microwave spec- troscopy performed as in our previous work [25]. Rather than using a bias tee setup, we use a microwave probe to directly excite free space cavity modes of our vacuum chamber. The results are shown in fig. 5. With the mag- netic pins aligned, it is seen that higher values of Bcoil in- deed increases the population of molecules able to survive at higher fields. In order to perform this spectroscopy, the trapping electric fields are switched off immediately prior to the application of a microwave transfer pulse tuned to a particular magnetic field strength. Thus the results reflect the Zeeman potential energy only, and onlyFIG. 5.imity of loss to the trap center.Microwave Thermometry. Bias field tunes the prox-loosely correspond to the total potential energy of the molecules. Nonetheless, the shift in population center is clear and in agreement with our expectation.In the case of lowest applied magnetic field in fig. 5, i.e. deepest cutting of the loss region toward the trap center, a negative going signal is observed. This indi- cates a build-up in the opposite parity weak electric field seeking state. Although the spin-flips we have discussed connect strong and weak field seeking magnetic states, other avoided crossings amongst the ground state man- ifold result in the spin-flipped molecules remaining very weakly trapped in a secondary state with opposite parity character in some regions.Once the loss is fully removed, we observe the trend in panel (a) of fig. 4. The decay rate decreases with popu- lation over a timescale that is long compared with trap frequency and is thus suggestive of a collisional process. However, a completely phase-space blind density reduc- tion technique [31] that significantly reduces our molecule number causes little change in the trend, indicating that single-particle physics is responsible. This is attributable to our warmer initial temperature than in previous ex- periments. The slowly decaying trend could be related to the existence of high energy chaotic orbits with long escape times, as seen in other exotically shaped trapping potentials [32]. We hope in the near future to implement several molecule number enhancement strategies.Our dual quadrupole trap decisively overcomes molecule enhanced spin-flip loss by tuning it from an overwhelming rate to complete removal. Our explana- tion of the loss provides detailed predictions of how its location and magnitude ought to scale with bias field and
trap alignment, which we have experimentally verified. Our results contradict existing predictions about molec- ular spin-flips in mixed fields and we provide a consis- tent framework that explains this based on internal spin- dynamics. We have devised a viable trapping geometry in which spin-flip loss is fully mitigated without trap-depth sacrifice, paving the way toward further improvements in molecule trapping and cooling.It is unclear how much of the collisional effect describedin [19] remains. This will be the subject of further inves-Spin-flip loss would have interfered with evaporation be- fore 5 mK was attained.
