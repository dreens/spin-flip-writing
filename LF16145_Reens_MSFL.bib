abstract = {Chemical reactions can be surprisingly efficient at ultracold temperatures ( {\textless} 1mK) due to the wave nature of atoms and molecules. The study of reactions in the ultracold regime is a new research frontier enabled by cooling and trapping techniques developed in atomic and molecular physics. In addition, ultracold molecular gases that offer diverse molecular internal states and large electric dipolar interactions are sought after for studies of strongly interacting many-body quantum physics. Here we propose a new approach for producing ultracold molecules in the absolute internal and motional quantum ground state, where single molecules are assembled one by one from individual atoms. The scheme involves laser cooling, optical trapping, Raman sideband cooling, and coherent molecular state transfer. As a crucial initial step, we demonstrate quantum control of constituent atoms, including 3D ground-state cooling of a single Cs atom, in a simple apparatus. As laser technology advances to shorter wavelengths, additional atoms will be amenable to laser-cooling, allowing more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules to be assembled with full quantum control.},

By attaining densities higher than 10{\^{}}9/cm3 and interaction times longer than 25 ms in samples of fluoromethane as well as deuterated ammonia, we observe cold dipolar collisions between molecules and determine their collision cross sections.},

abstract = {Exploring inelastic and reactive collisions on the quantum level is a main goal of the developing field of ultracold chemistry. We present first experimental studies of inelastic collisions of metastable ultracold triplet molecules in the vibrational ground state. The measurements are performed with nonpolar Rb{\$}{\_}2{\$} dimers which are prepared in precisely-defined quantum states and trapped in an array of quasi-1D potential tubes. We investigate collisions of molecules in the lowest triplet energy level where any inelastic process requires a relaxation to the singlet state. These are compared to two sets of collision experiments, carried out either with triplet molecules that have two quanta of rotational angular momentum or with vibrationally highly excited Feshbach molecules. We find no evidence for suppression of the inelastic collisions due to the necessary spin-flip, shedding light on this so far unsettled issue. For each of the molecular states studied here, we extract the decay rate constant and compare the results to theoretical predictions. Our investigations show a strong dependence of the decay rate constants on the confinement strength and the collision energy. This might be exploited to control the collisional properties of molecules.},

A molecular magneto-optical trap has been demonstrated, where molecules approached the Doppler limit. However, the sub-Doppler temperatures required for most applications have not yet been reached. Here we cool molecules to 50 uK, well below the Doppler limit, using a three-dimensional optical molasses.

abstract = {Supersonic beams are a prevalent source of cold molecules utilized in the study of chemical reactions, atom interferometry, gas-surface interactions, precision spectroscopy, molecular cooling and more. The triumph of this method emanates from the high densities produced in relation to other methods, however beam density remains fundamentally limited by interference with shock waves reflected from collimating surfaces. Here we show experimentally that this shock interaction can be reduced or even eliminated by cryo-cooling the interacting surface. An increase in beam density of nearly an order of magnitude was measured at the lowest surface temperature, with no further fundamental limitation reached. Visualization of the shock waves by plasma discharge and reproduction with direct simulation Monte Carlo calculations both indicate that the suppression of the shock structure is partially caused by lowering the momentum flux of reflected particles, and significantly enhanced by the adsorption of particles to the surface. We observe that the scaling of beam density with source pressure is recovered, paving the way to order of magnitude brighter cold molecular beams.},

The translational temperature of the trapped CH3 radicals was about 200 mK. The methyl radical is a non-polar polyatomic molecule, which is predicted to be an ideal system for further cooling below 1 mK via sympathetic cooling with ultracold atoms. In addition, it is a highly reactive intermediate that plays an important role in various processes in cold environments such as planetary atmospheres and the interstellar medium. The demonstrated trapping capability of methyl radicals opens up various possibilities for realizing ultracold ensembles of molecules towards Bose-Einstein condensation of polyatomic molecules and investigations of reactions governed by quantum statistics.},

abstract = {Anisotropy is a fundamental property of particle interactions. It occupies a central role in cold and ultra-cold molecular processes, where long range forces have been found to significantly depend on orientation in ultra-cold polar molecule collisions. Recent experiments have demonstrated the emergence of quantum phenomena such as scattering resonances in the cold collisions regime due to quantization of the intermolecular degrees of freedom. Although these states have been shown to be sensitive to interaction details, the effect of anisotropy on quantum resonances has eluded experimental observation so far. Here, we directly measure the anisotropy in atom-molecule interactions via quantum resonances by changing the quantum state of the internal molecular rotor. We observe that a quantum scattering resonance at a collision energy of {\$}k{\_}B{\$} x 270 mK appears in the Penning ionization of molecular hydrogen with metastable helium only if the molecule is rotationally excited. We use state of the art ab initio and multichannel quantum molecular dynamics calculations to show that the anisotropy contributes to the effective interaction only for {\$}H{\_}2{\$} molecules in the first excited rotational state, whereas rotationally ground state {\$}H{\_}2{\$} interacts purely isotropically with metastable helium. Control over the quantum state of the internal molecular rotation allows us to switch the anisotropy on or off and thus disentangle the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the interaction. These quantum phenomena provide a challenging benchmark for even the most advanced theoretical descriptions, highlighting the advantage of using cold collisions to advance the microscopic understanding of particle interactions.},

abstract = {Ultracold polar molecules, with their long-range electric dipolar interactions, offer a unique platform for studying correlated quantum many-body phenomena such as quantum magnetism. However, realizing a highly degenerate quantum gas of molecules with a low entropy per particle has been an outstanding experimental challenge. In this paper, we report the synthesis of a low entropy molecular quantum gas by creating molecules at individual sites of a three-dimensional optical lattice that is initially loaded from a low entropy mixture of K and Rb quantum gases. We make use of the quantum statistics and interactions of the initial atom gases to load into the optical lattice, simultaneously and with good spatial overlap, a Mott insulator of bosonic Rb atoms and a single-band insulator of fermionic K atoms. Then, using magneto-association and optical state transfer, we efficiently produce ground-state molecules in the lattice at those sites that contained one Rb and one K atom. The achieved filling fraction of 25{\%} indicates an entropy as low as {\$}2.2\backslash,k{\_}B{\$} per molecule. This low-entropy molecular quantum gas opens the door to novel studies of transport and entanglement propagation in a many-body system with long-range dipolar interactions.},

abstract = {A unique property of Zeeman effect based manipulation of paramagnetic particle's motion is the ability to control velocities of both atoms and molecules. In particular the moving magnetic trap decelerator is capable of slowing and eventually trapping mixtures of both cold atoms and cold molecules generated in a supersonic expansion. Here we report the deceleration of molecular oxygen together with metastable argon atoms. The cold mixture with temperature below 1 K is slowed from an initial velocity of 430 m s −1 down to 100 m s −1 . Our decelerator spans 2.4 m and consists of 480 quadrupole traps. Our results pave the way for the study of sympathetic cooling of molecules by laser cooled atoms. The production of cold and ultracold molecules is a growing field fueled by many possible applications in different disciplines such as cold chemistry, precision spectroscopy and degenerate quantum gas research. The internal molecular degrees of freedom such as rotation or vibration, which are absent in atoms, offer many opportunities. However, they also introduce complexity, presenting new experimental challenges, such that novel methods need to be developed to gain access and control over the additional degrees of freedom. Despite the growing effort, production of ultracold molecular ensembles is still a formidable experimental challenge with no proven and general methods for cooling and trapping. Laser-cooling, while largely successful and straightforward for particular atoms, can only be applied to a small set of molecules with favorable vibrational transitions [1–3]. Several alternative approaches for producing cold molecules are currently being pursued in various labs around the world. The indirect strategy uses laser-cooled alkali-metal atoms, which are assembled into ultra-cold molecules via photo-association [4] and magneto-association[5, 6]. Utilizing the well established techniques from the field of cold atoms, few bi-alkali molecules have been produced at ultra cold temperatures and even close to the quantum degeneracy limit [7]. Direct approaches include buffer gas cooling, where molecules are cooled by collisions with helium atoms in cryogenic environment [8]. The obtained temperatures are typically in the range of 0.5–4 K where even lower temperatures can be reached by applying velocity filtering [9]. Using these techniques a large variety of atomic and molecular species have been cooled and few paramagnetic molecular species have been trapped in deep magnetic traps generated by superconducting coils [10]. Finally the efficient cooling of both internal and translational degrees of freedom taking place during adiabatic expansion of supersonic beams can be combined with a variety of methods that allow for the manipulation of the beam mean velocity. The benefits of supersonic beams as a source of cold atoms or molecules have been already realized half a century ago. Here, the high flux of atoms and small molecules can be produced with all the degrees of freedom cooled to about 1 K but translationally accelerated in the forward direction to velocities of several hundreds to thousands of meters per second. Supersonic beams are produced by the adiabatic expansion of a high pressure gas through a small aperture into vacuum. In addition to the carrier gas, which is typically a noble gas such as He, Ne, Ar or Kr, many other atoms and molecules can be entrained or seeded into the beam by means of laser ablation or passing the beam through a vapor cell. For some applications, such as merged beams cold-collision experiments [11], the high beam velocity in the lab frame of reference does not impose a fundamental limit. However, in order to approach quantum degeneracy it is necessary to apply additional phase space compression OPEN ACCESS},

The phase space is a mixture of regular and chaotic orbits, the latter becoming dominant as the energy of the atoms increases. The trapping capabilities of these perpendicular Gaussian beams are investigated by considering an atomic ensemble in free motion. After a sudden turn on of the dipole trap, a certain fraction of atoms in the ensemble remains trapped. The majority of these trapped atoms has energies larger than the escape channels, which can be explained by the existence of regular and chaotic orbits with very long escape times.},

Here, we use a Stark decelerator to form a beam of state-selected and velocity-controlled NO radicals and measure state-to-state differential cross-sections for inelastic collisions of NO with He, Ne and Ar atoms using velocity map imaging. The monochromatic velocity distribution of the NO beam produced scattering images with unprecedented sharpness and angular resolution, thereby fully resolving quantum diffraction oscillations.

abstract = {Polar molecules have a rich internal structure and long-range dipole-dipole interactions, making them useful for quantum-controlled applications and fundamental investigations. Their potential fully unfolds at ultracold temperatures, where various effects are predicted in many-body physics, quantum information science, ultracold chemistry and physics beyond the standard model. Whereas a wide range of methods to produce cold molecular ensembles have been developed, the cooling of polyatomic molecules (that is, with three or more atoms) to ultracold temperatures has seemed intractable. Here we report the experimental realization of optoelectrical cooling, a recently proposed cooling and accumulation method for polar molecules. Its key attribute is the removal of a large fraction of a molecule's kinetic energy in each cycle of the cooling sequence via a Sisyphus effect, allowing cooling with only a few repetitions of the dissipative decay process. We demonstrate the potential of optoelectrical cooling by reducing the temperature of about one million CH(3)F molecules by a factor of 13.5, with the phase-space density increased by a factor of 29 (or a factor of 70 discounting trap losses). In contrast to other cooling mechanisms, our scheme proceeds in a trap, cools in all three dimensions and should work for a large variety of polar molecules. With no fundamental temperature limit anticipated down to the photon-recoil temperature in the nanokelvin range, we expect our method to be able to produce ultracold polyatomic molecules. The low temperatures, large molecule numbers and long trapping times of up to 27 seconds should allow an interaction-dominated regime to be attained, enabling collision studies and investigation of evaporative cooling towards a Bose-Einstein condensate of polyatomic molecules.},

abstract = {Cold and ultracold polar molecules with nonzero electronic angular momentum are of great interest for studies in quantum chemistry and control, investigations of novel quantum systems, and precision measurement. However, in mixed electric and magnetic fields, these molecules are generically subject to a large set of avoided crossings among their Zeeman sublevels; in magnetic traps, these crossings lead to distorted potentials and trap loss from electric bias fields. We have characterized these crossings in OH by microwave-transferring trapped OH molecules from the upper |f; M = +3/2{\textgreater} parity state to the lower |e; +3/2{\textgreater} state and observing their trap dynamics under an applied electric bias field. Our observations are very well described by a simple Landau-Zener model, yielding insight to the rich spectra and dynamics of polar radicals in mixed external fields.},

abstract = {Atomic physics was revolutionized by the development of forced evaporative cooling, which led directly to the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum-degenerate Fermi gases and ultracold optical lattice simulations of condensed-matter phenomena. More recently, substantial progress has been made in the production of cold molecular gases. Their permanent electric dipole moment is expected to generate systems with varied and controllable phases, dynamics and chemistry. However, although advances have been made in both direct cooling and cold-association techniques, evaporative cooling has not been achieved so far. This is due to unfavourable ratios of elastic to inelastic scattering and impractically slow thermalization rates in the available trapped species. Here we report the observation of microwave-forced evaporative cooling of neutral hydroxyl (OH(•)) molecules loaded from a Stark-decelerated beam into an extremely high-gradient magnetic quadrupole trap. We demonstrate cooling by at least one order of magnitude in temperature, and a corresponding increase in phase-space density by three orders of magnitude, limited only by the low-temperature sensitivity of our spectroscopic thermometry technique. With evaporative cooling and a sufficiently large initial population, much colder temperatures are possible; even a quantum-degenerate gas of this dipolar radical (or anything else it can sympathetically cool) may be within reach.},

In particular, samples of ground-state molecules at ultralow temperatures and high number densities will allow novel quantum-gas studies and future applications in quantum information science. However, high phase-space densities for molecular samples are not readily attainable as efficient cooling techniques such as laser cooling are lacking. Here we produce an ultracold and dense sample of molecules in a single hyperfine level of the rovibronic ground state with each molecule individually trapped in the motional ground state of an optical lattice well. Starting from a zero-temperature atomic Mott-insulator state with optimized double-site occupancy, weakly-bound dimer molecules are efficiently associated on a Feshbach resonance and subsequently transferred to the rovibronic ground state by a stimulated four-photon process with {\textgreater}50 {\%} efficiency. The molecules are trapped in the lattice and have a lifetime of 8 s. Our results present a crucial step towards Bose-Einstein condensation of ground-state molecules and, when suitably generalized to polar heteronuclear molecules, the realization of dipolar quantum-gas phases in optical lattices.},

@article{Shuman2010,
abstract = {It has been roughly three decades since laser cooling techniques produced ultracold atoms, leading to rapid advances in a wide array of fields. Laser cooling has not yet been extended to molecules because of their complex internal structure. However, this complexity makes molecules potentially useful for a wide range of applications. For example, heteronuclear molecules possess permanent electric dipole moments that lead to long-range, tunable, anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions. The combination of the dipole-dipole interaction and the precise control over molecular degrees of freedom possible at ultracold temperatures makes ultracold molecules attractive candidates for use in quantum simulations of condensed-matter systems and in quantum computation. Also, ultracold molecules could provide unique opportunities for studying chemical dynamics and for tests of fundamental symmetries. Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of the polar molecule strontium monofluoride (SrF). Using an optical cycling scheme requiring only three lasers, we have observed both Sisyphus and Doppler cooling forces that reduce the transverse temperature of a SrF molecular beam substantially, to a few millikelvin or less. At present, the only technique for producing ultracold molecules is to bind together ultracold alkali atoms through Feshbach resonance or photoassociation. However, proposed applications for ultracold molecules require a variety of molecular energy-level structures (for example unpaired electronic spin, Omega doublets and so on). Our method provides an alternative route to ultracold molecules. In particular, it bridges the gap between ultracold (submillikelvin) temperatures and the ∼1-K temperatures attainable with directly cooled molecules (for example with cryogenic buffer-gas cooling or decelerated supersonic beams). Ultimately, our technique should allow the production of large samples of molecules at ultracold temperatures for species that are chemically distinct from bialkalis.},

@article{Wall2010,
abstract = {In a Stark decelerator, polar molecules are slowed down and focussed by an inhomogeneous electric field which switches between two configurations. For the decelerator to work, it is essential that the molecules follow the changing electric field adiabatically. When the decelerator switches from one configuration to the other, the electric field changes in magnitude and direction, and this can cause molecules to change state. In places where the field is weak, the rotation of the electric field vector during the switch may be too rapid for the molecules to maintain their orientation relative to the field. Molecules that are at these places when the field switches may be lost from the decelerator as they are transferred into states that are not focussed. We calculate the probability of nonadiabatic transitions as a function of position in the periodic decelerator structure and find that for the decelerated group of molecules the loss is typically small, while for the un-decelerated group of molecules the loss can be very high. This loss can be eliminated using a bias field to ensure that the electric field magnitude is always large enough. We demonstrate our findings by comparing the results of experiments and simulations for the Stark deceleration of LiH and CaF molecules. We present a simple method for calculating the transition probabilities which can easily be applied to other molecules of interest.},

Maximizing the lifetime of molecules in a trap is of great concern in current experiments, and we assess the effect of nonadiabatic transitions on obtainable trap lifetimes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPublished in: PRA 78, 033433 (2008)},

abstract = {The transverse motion inside a Stark decelerator plays a large role in the total efficiency of deceleration. We differentiate between two separate regimes of molecule loss during the slowing process. The first mechanism involves distributed loss due to coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion, while the second is a result of the rapid decrease of the molecular velocity within the final few stages. In this work, we describe these effects and present means for overcoming them. Solutions based on modified switching time sequences with the existing decelerator geometry lead to a large gain of stable molecules in the intermediate velocity regime, but fail to address the loss at very low final velocities. We propose a new decelerator design, the quadrupole-guiding decelerator, which eliminates distributed loss due to transverse/longitudinal couplings throughout the slowing process and also exhibits gain over normal deceleration to the lowest velocities.},

An adjustable electric field of sufficient magnitude to polarize the OH is superimposed on the trap in either a quadrupole or homogenous field geometry. The OH is confined by an overall potential established via molecular state mixing induced by the combined electric and magnetic fields acting on the molecule's electric dipole and magnetic dipole moments, respectively. An effective molecular Hamiltonian including Stark and Zeeman terms has been constructed to describe single molecule dynamics inside the trap. Monte Carlo simulation using this Hamiltonian accurately models the observed trap dynamics in various trap configurations. Confinement of cold polar molecules in a magnetic trap, leaving large, adjustable electric fields for control, is an important step towards the study of low energy dipole-dipole collisions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPublished in: Phys.

abstract = {The realization of superfluidity in a dilute gas of fermionic atoms, analogous to superconductivity in metals, represents a long-standing goal of ultracold gas research. In such a fermionic superfluid, it should be possible to adjust the interaction strength and tune the system continuously between two limits: a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type superfluid (involving correlated atom pairs in momentum space) and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in which spatially local pairs of atoms are bound together. This crossover between BCS-type superfluidity and the BEC limit has long been of theoretical interest, motivated in part by the discovery of high-temperature superconductors. In atomic Fermi gas experiments superfluidity has not yet been demonstrated; however, long-lived molecules consisting of locally paired fermions have been reversibly created. Here we report the direct observation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate created solely by adjusting the interaction strength in an ultracold Fermi gas of atoms. This state of matter represents one extreme of the predicted BCS-BEC continuum.},

Similarly, the ability to trap and cool molecules should facilitate the study of ultracold molecular physics and collisions6; improvements in molecular spectroscopy could be anticipated. Also, ultracold molecules could aid the search for electric dipole moments of elementary particles7. But although laser cooling (in the case of alkali metals1,8,9) and cryogenic surface thermalization (in the case of hydrogen10,11) are currently used to cool some atoms sufficiently to permit their loading into magnetic traps, such techniques are not applicable to molecules, because of the latter's complex internal energy-level structure. (Indeed, most atoms have resisted trapping by these techniques.) We have reported a more general loading technique12 based on elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas, and have used it to trap atomic chromium and europium13,14. Here we apply this technique to magnetically trap a molecular speciescalcium monohydride (CaH). We use Zeeman spectroscopy to determine the number of trapped molecules and their temperature, and set upper bounds on the cross-sectional areas of collisional relaxation processes. The technique should be applicable to many paramagnetic molecules and atoms.},

abstract = {We consider quantized motion of neutral atoms cooled below the recoil limit in a quadrupole magnetostatic trap. Because of Majorana transitions to untrapped levels near the point of zero field at the trap center, all quantum levels have a nonzero decay rate. The Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation associated with the potential g$\mu$B {\textperiodcentered} S (S is the total atomic spin) takes the form of coupled equations in r when the spinor components are expanded in spherical harmonics. We integrate the multichannel problem numerically to obtain asymptotic phase shifts, resonance energies, and widths. For S = 1/2, the lowest levels have widths somewhat less than their spacing. Thus the trap quantum-level structure might possibly be observable if the atoms are sufficiently cold, namely, in the 0.1-$\mu$K regime for most atoms and attainable trap field gradients. The width decreases rapidly with increasing MJ, the angular momentum about the symmetry axis. Spectroscopic linewidths of a few hertz are possible if there is enough population in the lowest levels with a few MJ quanta. The decay rate of the lowest levels, however, is probably too rapid for studying Bose–Einstein condensation in such a trap.},

abstract = {We investigate single-particle energy spectra of the hydroxyl free radical (OH) in the lowest electronic and rovibrational level under combined static electric and magnetic fields, as an example of heteronuclear polar diatomic molecules. In addition to the fine-structure interactions, the hyperfine interactions and centrifugal distortion effects are taken into account to yield the zero-field spectrum of the lowest {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/4/045014/njp511946ieqn1.gif] {\{}{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\{}{\{}\backslashPi {\}}{\_}{\{}3/2{\}}{\}}{\$}{\}} manifold to an accuracy of less than 2 kHz. We also examine level crossings and repulsions in the hyperfine structure induced by applied electric and magnetic fields. Compared to previous work, we found more than 10{\%} reduction of the magnetic fields at level repulsions in the Zeeman spectrum subjected to a perpendicular electric field. In addition, we find new level repulsions, which we call Stark-induced hyperfine level repulsions, that require both an electric field and hyperfine structure. It is important to take into account hyperfine structure when we investigate physics of OH molecules at micro-Kelvin temperatures and below.},
