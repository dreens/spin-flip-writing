\begin{abstract}
Doubly dipolar molecules exhibit complex internal spin-dynamics in combined electric and magnetic fields. Near magnetic trap minima, these spin-dynamics lead to enhancements in Majorana spin-flip transitions by many orders of magnitude relative to atoms, and are thus an important obstacle for progress in molecule trapping and cooling. The effect is strongest for Hund's case (a) states but is quite significant for Hund's case (b) as well. We study these internal spin-dynamics with OH molecules and devise a trap geometry where spin-flip loss can be tuned from over $200 \text{ s}^{-1} $ to complete removal with only a weak external bias coil and with no sacrifice of trap strength.
%A new electromagnetic trap geometry allows full tuning of complex molecular spin-dynamics in crossed electric and magnetic fields. If not tuned properly, these dynamics lead to spin-flip loss that afflicts a wide set of candidate molecules. The spin-flip loss can be significant even above $100\text{ mK}$ and varies inversely with temperature, so it's removal represents a critical step toward ultracold molecules. The trapping geometry features a $0.5 \text{ K}$ trap depth and $5 \text{ T/cm}$ trap strength, and allows spin-dynamics to be tuned with a weak external bias coil. Spin-flip loss is tuned in a $170 \text{ mK}$ sample of OH molecules from over $200 \text{ s}^{-1} $ to below the vacuum limited lifetime of $2 \text{ s}^{-1}$.

%\section{Introduction}
The ultracold regime extends toward molecules on many fronts~\cite{Carr2009}. KRb molecules have reached lattice quantum degeneracy~\cite{Moses2015} and other bialkalis continue to progress~\cite{Takekoshi2014, Park2015}. Creative and carefully engineered laser cooling strategies are tackling certain nearly vibrationally diagonal molecules~\cite{Hummon2013, Barry2014, Zhelyazkova2014, Steinecker2016, Hemmerling2016}. A diverse array of alternative strategies have succeeded to greater or lesser extents on other molecules~\cite{Doyle1998, Bethlem1999, Bochinski2003, Narevicius2008, Wiederkehr2012, Prehn2016}. All of these molecules will require secondary strategies like evaporation or sympathetic cooling to make further gains in phase space density. They also may face a familiar challenge: spin flip loss near the zero of a magnetic trap, but dramatically enhanced for many doubly dipolar molecules due to their internal spin dynamics in mixed electric and magnetic fields. 

The knowledge of spin flips or Majorana hops as an eventual trap lifetime limit predates the very first magnetic trapping of neutrals~\cite{Migdall1985}. Spin flips were directly observed near $10\,\mu\text{K}$ and overcome in the TOP trap~\cite{Petrich1995}, and soon later with a plugged dipole trap~\cite{Davis1995}, famously enabling the first Bose-Einstein condensates. In our earlier investigations, we observed OH trap loss with applied electric field \cite{Stuhl2012uwave}. This trap loss occurred for sub-states of OH's $X^2\Pi_{3/2}$ ground state manifold other than the most well-trapped one (Fig.~\ref{fig:blocking}, panel (d)), and was attributable to avoided crossings that open at non-zero magnetic fields between levels of opposite parity. We have now identified trap loss at zero magnetic field with the application of electric field that afflicts even the most well-trapped substate although it lacks any such crossings. We first suspected this during experiments in our previous trap geometry, a 3D permanent magnet quadrupole trap with homogeneous electric field \cite{Stuhl2013}, but it was difficult to disentangle it from competing effects.  Our new trap geometry addresses this, but we use our previous geometry as our starting point to explain the internal spin-dynamics that lead to the enhanced loss.

%We observe spin-flips in a Stark-decelerated OH sample, about four orders of magnitude higher in temperature compared with the atomic case. In our new dual quadrupole trap, it is possible to tune this loss over a wide dynamic range, but we begin with our previous geometry~\cite{Sawyer2008}, a 3D permanent magnet quadrupole trap with homogeneous electric field applied, as our starting point to explain the internal spin-dynamics that lead to the spin-flip loss. 
%In previous iterations of our OH trapping experiment, and in the most recent described here, we have observed molecular spin-flips at four order higher temperatures in the $45-170\text{ mK}$ range. The loss is connected to the doubly dipolar nature of molecules and thus to their behavior in mixed electric and magnetic fields. Such field mixing arises in any experiment which aims to take advantage of this doubly dipolar nature. The loss varies in 
%The observation was discussed briefly in the appendix of~\cite{Stuhl2013}.

%The electric field leads to a significant population decay beyond background gas collisions, initially attributed to collisional tuning. We now realize that the internal spin-dynamics of the molecules also result in these losses, with a magnitude sufficiently comparable so as to preclude deconvolution of any remaining collisional effect.\footnote{The existence of the internal spin-dynamical effect was known and described in the appendix of~\cite{Stuhl2013}, but more thorough recent investigations have demonstrated it to be of larger magnitude.} 

These internal spin-dynamics are subtle; it has taken a concentrated several year effort to elucidate the effect with conclusive experimental evidence as reported here. The effect has also eluded three previous investigations of note: In~\cite{Lara2008} the analogues of atomic spin-flip loss for molecules in mixed fields were studied, and a magnetic quadrupole trap for OH molecules with superposed electric field was specifically addressed. It was concluded that no significant loss enhancement due to electric field would be evident. While this is true for the approximate $^2\Pi_{1/2}$ Hamiltonian used in that study, it is not true for the actual $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ ground state of OH. In~\cite{Stuhl2013} E-fields were applied in our magnetic quadrupole trap to study E-field induced collisions. Although an initial suspicion existed of the effect we describe, efforts to deconvolve it underestimated its magnitude.~\footnote{Although the underestimate was only by a factor of three, it is unclear how much of the collisional effect described in~\cite{Stuhl2013} remains. This will be the subject of further investigation.} Finally, in~\cite{Bohn2013} it was correctly noted that Hund's case (a) molecules maintain a quantization axis in mixed fields. In fact the states of the molecule align with one of two quantization axes- either the vector sum or the vector difference of the dipole moment weighted electric and magnetic fields. It was asserted that this would maintain quantization near the zero of a quadrupole trap and avoid spin-flip loss. As we will now explain, quantization is indeed maintained, but spin-flip loss is enhanced:

%This is actually the crux of the internal spin-dynamics that lead to loss. 
With only magnetic field, a molecule remains trapped insofar as it adiabatically follows the field direction. Near the trap center, the direction changes most rapidly, enabling loss. When electric field is added, it dominates in the trap center where the magnetic field is weakest. Quantization is maintained but the quantization axis does not rotate with the magnetic field as it needs to. Further away from the trap center the molecule is then magnetically strong field seeking and is lost. The molecule ought to have switched from the vector sum quantization axis to the vector difference quantization axis, so as to remain doubly weak field seeking despite the change in relative orientation of the fields. To be more precise, we define the relative orientation of the fields as the sign of $\phi=\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$. When $\phi$ is negative (positive), the doubly trapped state must have the vector difference (sum) quantization axis, so that an increase in magnitude of either field increases it's energy. Orientation changes whenever $\phi$ changes sign, which occurs in a 2D region given by $\phi=0$, i.e. \epb. This region must be 2D, since it is a contour level of the 3D scalar valued function $\phi$. %\footnote{Without the lambda doubling perturbation, which connects the substates of different quantization axes and provides a barrier supportive of remaining in the doubly dipolar substate, a perfectly linear Stark effect molecule would be lost with unit probability anywhere in the orthogonal plane.}%So how could this occur while quantization is maintained? When electric field is added, there are actually two different quantization axes, obtained by either adding or subtracting the dipole moment weighted field vectors. In order to remain trapped a dipolar molecule must remain doubly stretched by the two fields, requiring alignment with either the vector addition or the vector subtraction quantization axis depending on whether the fields point toward or away from one another. In part of the trap fields point in the same direction, but on the other side they point opposite. Thus maintaining quantization axis is actually an impediment to remaining in the well trapped substate- the molecule must hop from one quantization axis to the other in order to remain trapped.

We can also understand this effect in terms of the energy splitting between the well trapped substate and it's spin-flip partner, since this splitting acts as a barrier to spin-flips. The preceding quantization axis discussion suggests that spin-flips occur when crossing the $\phi=0$ planar region, so we expect to find a correspondingly reduced energy splitting there. In Fig.~\ref{fig:blocking}, the energies of the well trapped state and its spin-flip partner are calculated by diagonalizing OH's $X^2\Pi_{3/2}$ ground state Hamiltonian verses B-field without E-field  in panel (a), with fixed E-field and $E$\raisebox{1px}{$\parallel$}$B$ so that $\phi$ is maximally nonzero in panel (b), and with fixed E-field and $\phi=0$ in panel (c). Indeed, we find a striking reduction in energy splitting for a wide range of magnetic fields in panel (c) compared with panel (b). In fact, by series expanding the exact eigenenergies of OH, we find $H_\epbm(B)\approx (\mu_BB)^3\Delta^2/(d_EE)^4$, $\Delta$ the lambda doubling term. The Zeeman splitting is no longer linear, but cubic. This means that the splitting will be small in a much larger region close to $B=0$ then otherwise.

%In terms of energies, this manifests as an unusually narrow Zeeman splitting in the region where the relative field orientation changes, i.e. where the fields are orthogonal. In our focus case this occurs in a plane through the trap center, but generally it is always a 2D region since it is a level set of the continuous scalar $\phi = E\cdot B$. In the subset of this plane where $\mu_BB<<d_EE$, the Zeeman effect is not linear but cubic. We call this ``blocking", see fig.~\ref{fig:blocking}, and we say that the E-field blocks the Zeeman effect from linear to cubic. Eventually the Zeeman effect overcomes the blocking and returns to linear when $d_EE\approx\mu_BB$. The Stark effect is not blocked by the Zeeman thanks to lambda doubling, which gives a large fixed energy barrier to electric field misalignment.

This observation allows us to develop a scaling law for the loss enhancement in this geometry. For a given trap strength and sample temperature, there is a characteristic energy splitting $\kappa$ below which spin-flips can occur, calculated from the Landau-Zener formula. In our case $\kappa=5\text{ MHz}$. As shown in panel (e) of Fig.~\ref{fig:blocking}, E-field widens the $\kappa$ valued energy contour near the trap zero, greatly increasing the flux through this region. Note also that the energy gradient near the loss region, which also contributes to the Landau-Zener hopping probability, remains nearly identical in the z-direction between panels (d) and (e). Solving for $B$ when $H_\epbm(B)=\kappa$ and dividing by the $E=0$ case gives the flux enhancement factor $\nu = (d_EE/\sqrt{\kappa\Delta})^{8/3}$. So E-fields beyond $\sqrt{\kappa\Delta}/d_E$ lead to almost cubic enhancements in spin-flip loss. We can be more quantitative by integrating the velocity distribution and the flux through the plane, accounting for the velocity dependent Landau-Zener probability, Table.~\ref{tab:rates}. The spin-flip loss is negligible at $50\text{ mK}$, but relevant at the $5\text{ mK}$ targeted during evaporation~\cite{Stuhl2012evap}. Those results will thus require reinterpretation considering this effect~\footnote{Spin-flip loss would have interfered with evaporation before $5\text{ mK}$ was attained. Some phase space compression does seem to have occurred at $20\text{ mK}$.}. With the goal of $\mu\text{K}$ temperatures and below, it is clear spin-flip loss must be addressed. 

For Hund's case (a) states more generally, the Zeeman splitting when \epb{}  is reduced from linear to order $2J$, according to several test Hamiltonians we have diagonalized. This also agrees with the intuition that when $\mu_BB<<d_EE$ and \epb, the magnetic field must un-do the electric field's coupling of opposite $m_J$ number states, a task of order $m_J-(-m_J)=2J$. Only $J=1/2$ states remain linear, but their vanishing g-factor renders them untrappable already. For Hund's case (b) the enhanced loss region is restricted to the trap energy regime where $\gamma$ the spin-rotation coupling dominates. In this regime the state is effectively Hund's case (a). This can still be very significant, for example $\gamma=75\text{ MHz}$ for SrF~\cite{Quemener2016}. In preliminary investigations for Hund's case (b) molecules, which essentially consist of reproducing panels (a)-(c) of Fig.~\ref{fig:blocking} for different Hamiltonians, we find large spin-flip loss enhancements for SrF's v=0, N=1 magnetically trappable substates. Some Hund's case (b) molecular states such as YO's v=0, N=1 manifold have a protected substate with $m_F=0$ and thus no hopping partner in the spin-rotation coupling regime that is nonetheless energetically separated from other state-crossings by the lamb-shift. This state is less strongly trappable due to the same $m_F=0$ feature, but is fully spin-flip immune.

%This informs a general strategy to address spin-flip loss: keep $\mu_BB>\cdot d_EE$ where \epb. 

%The size of the spin-flip loss region can be more precisely computed for different molecules. , but $\mu_BB>\cdot d_EE$ works as an approximate rule. For OH we can analytically express the ground state energy and series expand the result to find $H_\text{Zeeman}\approx (\mu_BB)^3\Delta^2/(d_EE)^4$, $\Delta$ the lambda doubling term. For a general Hund's case (a) molecule, we find the $\mu_BB$ term raised to the power of $2J$. Hund's case (b) suffer to the extent of their non-zero spin-rotation coupling term $\gamma$. 

% Blocking Paragraph:
%Essentially, the loss enhancement is related to the sensitivity of molecules to the relative orientation of $E$ and $B$ fields;  in the familiar atomic case it is only the rotation of the magnetic field relative to the lab frame that induces spin-flips. For Hund's case (a) molecules with full spin-rotation coupling, or for case (b) molecules to the extent that their spin-rotation coupling $\gamma$ is nonzero, electric and magnetic energy shifts add linearly when the fields are parallel but sublinearly when the fields are orthogonal. Consequentially, the presence of a constant orthogonal electric field reduces the magnitude of the Zeeman splitting. We call this effect ``blocking". For OH's most strongly trapped substate, the Zeeman splitting to the next highest state is blocked from linear to cubic as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:blocking}.  The result of this blocking is that when $\mu_BB < d_EE$ and \epb, the energy gap between states of opposite magnetic quantum number is small, and spin-flips can occur. In a magnetic quadrupole trapping geometry with homogeneous overlapping electric field, these conditions are met on a disk through the origin whose size is controlled by the magnitude of $E$. On either side of the disk, blocking returns to linear. This is a worst case scenario, since $P_{\text{flip}}\propto e^{-\Delta^2/(dH/dt)}$ and we have not only small $\Delta$ but large $dH/dt$ for molecules crossing the disk. Panel (e) of fig.~\ref{fig:blocking} illustrates this.



% Splitting Order Paragraph
%To develop some intuition for this, we work in the basis of total angular momentum $J$ and parity $\epsilon$ which is appropriate for Hund's case (a). The eight states in this basis for OH's $J=3/2$ ground state are indicated by the state ket $|\epsilon\!=\!f,e\;;\;m_J\!=\!\pm1/2,\pm3/2\rangle$. An electric field splits states according to the absolute value of their $m_J$ number, with $|f,\pm3/2\rangle$ shifting upward strongly, $|f,\pm1/2\rangle$ one third as strongly, and the negative parity $|e\rangle$ states shifting oppositely. A magnetic field linearly splits states in proportion with $m_J$. Since we use electric fields for slowing and magnetic for trapping, only $|f,3/2\rangle$ are trapped. When an electric field has already set the quantization axis with respect to which $m_J$ is defined, the orthogonal magnetic field sees this as a coupling of $|f,3/2\rangle$ to $|f,-3/2\rangle$ which must be overcome. This is a $3/2-(-3/2)=3^\text{rd}$ order task, hence the cubic Zeeman splitting. If $E\parallel B$, this basis change is unnecessary and the Zeeman splitting is not blocked. For the $|m_J|=1/2$ states, realigning the quantization axis when \epb{} is a $1/2-(-1/2)=1^\text{st}$ order task, so the splitting remains linear; see the gray lines close to zero field in panel (c) of fig.~\ref{fig:blocking}. Similarly, in ref.~\cite{Lara2008}, it was specifically undertaken to investigate the spin-flip loss for OH molecules in a magnetic quadrupole trap with superposed electric field, and no enhancement was found because a simplified $J=1/2$ Hamiltonian was used.


% Relation showing the enhancement
%We can apply Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory or analytically solve the ground state eigenenergies and taylor expand to obtain the following functional form for the Zeeman splitting between the $|f,\pm3/2\rangle$ states where \epb:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:HZprop}
%H_Z\approx \frac{(1.4\mu_BB)^3}{(1.7d_EE)^4}\Delta^2 f(\Delta,d_EE)
%\end{equation}
%\noindent Here $\mu_B$ and $d_E$ are the bohr magneton and the Debye, $B$ and $E$ are the corresponding field magnitudes, $\Delta$ is the lambda doublet splitting in energy units, and $f$ represents a complicated term of order unity for $d_EE < \Delta$ and order $d_EE/\Delta$ for larger $E$. We can use this to develop a scaling law for the enhancement. Let $\kappa$ be the energy threshold for gaps between states below which spin-flips are possible at the 50\% level. $\kappa$ depends on the mean velocity of trapped species and on the trap gradient near the hopping region, and so must be separately computed for any given scenario. For OH molecules in a  quadrupole trap~\cite{sawyer2008} with strong gradient $2 \text{T/cm}$ and temperature $50 \text{mK}$, $\kappa=5\text{MHz}$. Without electric field, the effective cross sectional area for a hopping region is approximately $\pi (\kappa/\mu_BB\prime)^2$, approximating the ellipsoidal region given by $\mu_BB<\kappa$ as a flat disk. With electric field, a much larger magnetic field is required to overcome blocking, so we have from eq.~\ref{eq:HZprop} that $\mu_BB < \sqrt[3]{\frac{\kappa (d_EE)^4}{\Delta^2}}$, so for $d_EE>\sqrt{\kappa\Delta}$ there is an enhancement given by the following equation:
%\begin{equation}
%\nu = \left(\frac{d_EE}{\sqrt{\kappa\Delta}}\right)^\frac{8}{3}
%\label{eq:blimit}
%\end{equation} 



%~\footnote{For this and other reasons, it is evident that $5\text{ mK}$ temperatures were not actually attained. However it does seem that some phase space compression was achieved for $20\text{ mK}$ evaporations.}. With the goal of much colder temperatures than $5\text{ mK}$, it is clear that the spin-flip loss must be addressed.

%One obvious way to avoid the loss enhancement is to simply never use electric field in a magnetic trap. This prevents loss from being enhanced compared with atoms, but doesn't remove it entirely. Another possibility is to trap with electric fields, where no spin-flip loss is possible thanks to the $\Delta=h\,\cdot\,1.67\text{ GHz}$ splitting between the weak and strong field seeking states. However this splitting also results in a significant reduction in trap gradient close to the center, very undesirable for further cooling by evaporation. Moreover, there are reductions in inelastic to benefit from in magnetic fields.~\cite{Stuhl2012evap}

%Detection is realized via LIF with a $282\text{ nm}$ excitation in the x+y-z direction (pink) from $X^2\Pi_{3/2}(v=0)\rightarrow A^2\Sigma(v=1)$, and fluorescence at $313\text{ nm}$ from $A^2\Sigma(v=1)\rightarrow X^2\Pi_{3/2}(v=1)$ is focused by a lens (blue) onto a PMT in the z-direction.

We can generalize to arbitrary geometries and consider methods to avoid the loss using a simple strategy: avoid $\mu_BB < d_EE$ where \epb. One way to achieve this is to trap with E-field and superpose B-field. The lambda doublet prevents flips in this configuration, but it does round the trap minimum considerably. Another option is to trap with both fields and keep zeros overlapped. This was once realized for OH with a superposed magnetic quadrupole and electric hexapole~\cite{Sawyer2007}. Such a scheme prevents spin-flip loss enhancement, but does not remove it entirely. It is also susceptible to misalignment induced loss enhancement. Another possibility is to use one field only. While this avoids spin-flip loss enhancement, any experiment which aims to make use of the doubly dipolar nature of molecules cannot accept this compromise.

%Seeking to remove the loss entirely but without sacrificing trap depth or gradient, we use  
We opt for a geometry that is distinct from these options: a pair of 2D quadrupole traps, one magnetic and the other electric, with orthogonal centerlines. We achieve these fields in a geometry that matches our Stark decelerator~\cite{Bochinski2003}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CAD}. This approach is similar to the Ioffe-Pritchard strategy~\cite{pritchard1983}, where a 2D magnetic quadrupole is combined with an axial dipole trap. Axial and radial trapping interfere, resulting in significantly lower trap depths than the 3D quadrupole. We thwart this interference by using electric field for the third direction. Our geometry has \epb{} along both the $xz$ and $yz$ planes, with $\mu_BB < d_EE$ in a large cylinder surrounding the $z$-axis. However, by adding magnetic field $\vec{B}=B_\text{coil}\hat{z}$ along the centerline of the magnetic quadrupole with an external bias coil, a fully tunable scenario emerges. %the \epb{} surface can be morphed into a hyperbolic sheet that does not approach closely to the magnetic minimum axis except far away from the trap center, thus preventing $\mu_BB < d_EE$.% , which can ``block" one another as discussed earlier but never result in an absolute decrease in potential energy of the doubly weak field seeking substate. 

%According to our intuition and our phase space coupling simulations, this integrated trap represents a near best-case scenario for coupling between a pulsed decelerator and a trap and ought to provide trap-averaged temperatures below $100\text{ mK}$. In practice we do not realize any significant molecule number increase relative to our previous trap geometries and temperatures are $170\text{ mK}$. This could be related to the difficulty of conditioning the magnet surfaces, which could be micro-discharging during operation leading to heating during loading. Finer polishing of the magnetic pins should address this.

\end{figure}

Adding $B_\text{coil}$ only slightly rounds the magnetic trapping potential, but it morphs the \epb{} surface from a pair of planes into a hyperbolic sheet, pushing it away from the $z$-axis where the magnetic field is smallest. This means that small magnitudes of $B_\text{coil}$  are sufficient to avoid $\mu_BB< d_EE$ where \epb. In Fig.~\ref{fig:LSurfs}, the surfaces where \epb{} for several $B_\text{coil}$ magnitudes are shown wherever the splitting there is below the hopping threshold $\kappa$. Note how $B_\text{coil}$ tunes the proximity of the loss regions to the trap center. The loss regions are always visible, but they are tuned so far away that molecules accessing them have already escaped the trap. The striking difference in molecule trap lifetime with and without $B_\text{coil}$ can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:WVplot}, panel (a).

A one body fit (gray) to the data without bias field yields a $200\text{ s}^{-1}$ loss rate. A one body fit (black) to the long time bias field data yields a $2\text{ s}^{-1}$ loss rate, in agreement with our background gas pressure.

As a further confirmation of our \epb{}  and $\mu_BB<d_EE$ model of the loss, we translate our magnetic pins along the $\hat{x}$ direction in their mounts to alter the surface where \epb{}  and compare experimental data against our expectations. The data are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:WVplot}, panel (b). Qualitatively, this translation serves to disrupt the otherwise perfectly 2D magnetic quadrupole by adding a small trapping field $\vec{B}\propto B^\prime z\hat{z}$ along the z-axis. This means that $B_\text{coil}$ no longer directly tunes the magnetic field magnitude along the z-axis. Instead, $B_\text{coil}$ must first overcome the slight trapping field along the $z$-axis, translating a point of zero field along the z axis and eventually out of the trap. The point of zero magnetic field has $\mu_BB<d_EE$ and lies on the $\phi=\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}=0$ surface by definition, leading to strong loss unless it is aligned with the trap center, where $E$ is also zero. This means that without any bias field, the loss should actually be a local minimum; as the field is increased in either direction the loss should first worsen and then improve when the zero leaves the trap. This qualitative explanation correctly predicts the observed double well structure.

Quantitatively, we fit the family of curves shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:WVplot}(b) by performing an integration of molecule flux weighted by Landau-Zener probability and Maxwell-Boltzmann population density over the strangely twisted surfaces where \epb{} for each $B_\text{coil}$ and pin offset. The computation is performed in COMSOL Multiphysics, with cloud temperature as the only free parameter~\footnote{Soure code: https://github.com/dreens/spin-flip-integration/}. The asymmetry of the curves about $B_\text{coil}=0$ comes from a slight shift of the electric quadrupole minimum caused by an intentional bending of the last pin pair to increase fluorescence collection along $\hat{z}$. The fitted temperature is in the $100-200$ mK range, larger than expected from our simulations, despite the known defocusing and reflection losses that accompany pulsed decelerators at low speeds~\cite{Sawyer2008a}. This may be related to micro-discharges on the surfaces of the magnetic pins during the final deceleration pulse, since these pins are less well polished. This could be overcome with various polishing strategies.

We further confirm the consistency of our model of the loss using microwave spectroscopy as performed as in our previous work~\cite{Stuhl2012evap}. Instead of using a bias tee setup, we use a microwave probe to excite free space modes of our vacuum chamber in a near field manner. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spec}. It is seen that increasing $B_{\text{coil}}$ increases population first at low fields and then at higher fields. This is consistent with our calculations of the location of the loss as presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:LSurfs}. In order to perform this spectroscopy, the trapping electric fields are switched off immediately prior to Zeeman specific microwave transfer pulses. Thus the results reflect the Zeeman potential energy only, which in the ensemble average tracks potential energy but is not directly proportional. Nonetheless, the shift in population center is clear and in agreement with our expectation.  %Roughly speaking, the average field of $2\text{ kG}$ corresponds to $200\text{ mK}$ for OH. Since this is approximately half the potential energy, we have $U\approx400\text{ mK}$. From the virial theorem for a linear trap, $U = 4.5k_BT$, so we can say the spectrum is consistent with $T\approx 90\text{ mK}$ and consistent with our fitting in fig.~\ref{fig:WVplot}.

%a challenging prospect with our trap deeply integrated in the high voltage decelerator, 

In the case of lowest applied magnetic field in Fig.~\ref{fig:spec}, a negative going signal is observed. This indicates a build-up in the opposite parity weak electric field seeking state. Although the spin-flips we have discussed do not connect states of opposite parity, other avoided crossings amongst the ground state manifold result in the spin-flipped molecules remaining very weakly trapped in a secondary state with opposite parity character in some regions. %nonuniform gradient (repulsive in the center, attractive outside) and a much lower overall trap depth. This secondary state also exhibits spin-flip loss to other lower states, but the enhancement with electric field is related to a quadratic blocking of the Zeeman splitting, and is thus not as dominating as the loss in the primary state due to cubic blocking.

With loss removed, we observe the green-dotted trend in Fig.~\ref{fig:WVplot}(a). The decay rate decreases with population over the first $200\text{ ms}$, a timescale that is long compared with trap frequency and thus suggestive of a collisional process. To test this, we reduce the molecule number fivefold with a technique that ought to be phase-space blind so as to reduce the molecule density. We do this with microwaves as before, but coupling electrically weak and strong field seekers during the first half of deceleration. Spatial inhomogeneities on the order of the cloud size are unlikely given the $15\text{ cm}$ microwave wavelength, but any that exist are remixed during the remaining deceleration. The trend remains similar with this density-modulation, suggesting that single-particle physics is chiefly responsible. This discrepancy relative to our previous work is attributable to our warmer initial temperature. We hope soon to implement several density increasing measures and return to the collisional regime. The slowly varying but single-body decay rate could be related to the existence of high energy chaotic orbits with long escape times, as seen in other exotically shaped trapping potentials~\cite{Gonzalez-Ferez2014}.

Our dual quadrupole trap decisively overcomes molecule enhanced spin-flip loss by tuning it from an overwhelming rate to complete removal. Our explanation of the loss provides detailed predictions of how its location and magnitude ought to scale with bias field and trap alignment, which we have experimentally verified. Our results correct existing predictions about molecular spin-flips in mixed fields and we provide a consistent framework that explains this based on internal spin-dynamics. We have devised a viable trapping geometry in which spin-flip loss is fully mitigated without trap-depth sacrifice, paving the way toward further improvements in molecule trapping and cooling.
