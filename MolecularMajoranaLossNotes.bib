@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="In fact, the only reason a molecule can remain trapped at all in this configuration is thanks to the lambda doubling perturbation, which connects the substates of different quantization axes and creates a barrier to remaining in the same quantization axis. In a hypothetical perfectly linear Stark effect molecule without this doubling, an arbitrarily small stray electric field would cause complete trap loss for molecules crossing the center plane of the trap."}
