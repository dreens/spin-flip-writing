@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="It is unclear how much of a collisional effect described in~\cite {Stuhl2013} remains. This will need to be the subject of further investigation."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="Without the lambda doubling perturbation, which connects the substates of different quantization axes and provides a barrier supportive of remaining in the doubly dipolar substate, a perfectly linear Stark effect molecule would be lost with unit probability anywhere in the orthogonal plane."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="For this and other reasons, it is evident that $5\protect \text  { mK}$ temperatures were not actually attained. However it does seem that some phase space compression was achieved for $20\protect \text  { mK}$ evaporations."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="Soure code is available: https://github.com/dreens/spin-flip-integration/"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="Microwaves applied via our free space cavity mode probe couple electrically weak and strong field seeking states during deceleration. The microwave wavelength of $15\protect \text  { cm}$ is large compared with packet size, and the resonant energy corresponds to the low electric fields that all molecules experience when flying between stages."}
