@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="In fact, the only reason a molecule can remain trapped at all in this configuration is thanks to the lambda doubling perturbation, which connects the substates of different quantization axes and creates a barrier to remaining in the same quantization axis. In a hypothetical perfectly linear Stark effect molecule without this doubling, an arbitrarily small stray electric field would cause complete trap loss for molecules crossing the center plane of the trap."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="For this and other reasons, it is evident that $5\protect \text  { mK}$ temperatures were not actually attained. However it does seem that some phase space compression was achieved for $20\protect \text  { mK}$ evaporations."}

@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="Microwaves applied via our free space cavity mode probe couple electrically weak and strong field seeking states during deceleration. The microwave wavelength of $15\protect \text  { cm}$ is large compared with packet size, and the resonant energy corresponds to the low electric fields that all molecules experience when flying between stages."}
