abstract = {A unique property of Zeeman effect based manipulation of paramagnetic particle's motion is the ability to control velocities of both atoms and molecules. In particular the moving magnetic trap decelerator is capable of slowing and eventually trapping mixtures of both cold atoms and cold molecules generated in a supersonic expansion. Here we report the deceleration of molecular oxygen together with metastable argon atoms. The cold mixture with temperature below 1 K is slowed from an initial velocity of 430 m s −1 down to 100 m s −1 . Our decelerator spans 2.4 m and consists of 480 quadrupole traps. Our results pave the way for the study of sympathetic cooling of molecules by laser cooled atoms. The production of cold and ultracold molecules is a growing field fueled by many possible applications in different disciplines such as cold chemistry, precision spectroscopy and degenerate quantum gas research. The internal molecular degrees of freedom such as rotation or vibration, which are absent in atoms, offer many opportunities. However, they also introduce complexity, presenting new experimental challenges, such that novel methods need to be developed to gain access and control over the additional degrees of freedom. Despite the growing effort, production of ultracold molecular ensembles is still a formidable experimental challenge with no proven and general methods for cooling and trapping. Laser-cooling, while largely successful and straightforward for particular atoms, can only be applied to a small set of molecules with favorable vibrational transitions [1–3]. Several alternative approaches for producing cold molecules are currently being pursued in various labs around the world. The indirect strategy uses laser-cooled alkali-metal atoms, which are assembled into ultra-cold molecules via photo-association [4] and magneto-association[5, 6]. Utilizing the well established techniques from the field of cold atoms, few bi-alkali molecules have been produced at ultra cold temperatures and even close to the quantum degeneracy limit [7]. Direct approaches include buffer gas cooling, where molecules are cooled by collisions with helium atoms in cryogenic environment [8]. The obtained temperatures are typically in the range of 0.5–4 K where even lower temperatures can be reached by applying velocity filtering [9]. Using these techniques a large variety of atomic and molecular species have been cooled and few paramagnetic molecular species have been trapped in deep magnetic traps generated by superconducting coils [10]. Finally the efficient cooling of both internal and translational degrees of freedom taking place during adiabatic expansion of supersonic beams can be combined with a variety of methods that allow for the manipulation of the beam mean velocity. The benefits of supersonic beams as a source of cold atoms or molecules have been already realized half a century ago. Here, the high flux of atoms and small molecules can be produced with all the degrees of freedom cooled to about 1 K but translationally accelerated in the forward direction to velocities of several hundreds to thousands of meters per second. Supersonic beams are produced by the adiabatic expansion of a high pressure gas through a small aperture into vacuum. In addition to the carrier gas, which is typically a noble gas such as He, Ne, Ar or Kr, many other atoms and molecules can be entrained or seeded into the beam by means of laser ablation or passing the beam through a vapor cell. For some applications, such as merged beams cold-collision experiments [11], the high beam velocity in the lab frame of reference does not impose a fundamental limit. However, in order to approach quantum degeneracy it is necessary to apply additional phase space compression OPEN ACCESS},

@article{Bergeman1989,
abstract = {We consider quantized motion of neutral atoms cooled below the recoil limit in a quadrupole magnetostatic trap. Because of Majorana transitions to untrapped levels near the point of zero field at the trap center, all quantum levels have a nonzero decay rate. The Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation associated with the potential g$\mu$B {\textperiodcentered} S (S is the total atomic spin) takes the form of coupled equations in r when the spinor components are expanded in spherical harmonics. We integrate the multichannel problem numerically to obtain asymptotic phase shifts, resonance energies, and widths. For S = 1/2, the lowest levels have widths somewhat less than their spacing. Thus the trap quantum-level structure might possibly be observable if the atoms are sufficiently cold, namely, in the 0.1-$\mu$K regime for most atoms and attainable trap field gradients. The width decreases rapidly with increasing MJ, the angular momentum about the symmetry axis. Spectroscopic linewidths of a few hertz are possible if there is enough population in the lowest levels with a few MJ quanta. The decay rate of the lowest levels, however, is probably too rapid for studying Bose–Einstein condensation in such a trap.},

abstract = {Recent advances1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling of atoms to nanokelvin temperatures have opened important areas of research, such as BoseEinstein condensation and ultracold atomic collisions. Similarly, the ability to trap and cool molecules should facilitate the study of ultracold molecular physics and collisions6; improvements in molecular spectroscopy could be anticipated. Also, ultracold molecules could aid the search for electric dipole moments of elementary particles7. But although laser cooling (in the case of alkali metals1,8,9) and cryogenic surface thermalization (in the case of hydrogen10,11) are currently used to cool some atoms sufficiently to permit their loading into magnetic traps, such techniques are not applicable to molecules, because of the latter's complex internal energy-level structure. (Indeed, most atoms have resisted trapping by these techniques.) We have reported a more general loading technique12 based on elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas, and have used it to trap atomic chromium and europium13,14. Here we apply this technique to magnetically trap a molecular speciescalcium monohydride (CaH). We use Zeeman spectroscopy to determine the number of trapped molecules and their temperature, and set upper bounds on the cross-sectional areas of collisional relaxation processes. The technique should be applicable to many paramagnetic molecules and atoms.},

abstract = {A configuration of magnetic fields is exhibited which can harmonically trap paramag- netic particles in a shallow field minimum, superposed on a nearly uniform field which simplifies spectroscopic interactions with the particles. The potential energy of a trapped neutral particle depends on the particle's internal quantum number, as well as its posi- tion in the trap, permitting a combined rf-laser optical pumping cycle which can cool particles by a factor of 2 per cycle. Application of these ideas to the trapping of Na atoms is discussed.},

abstract = {Atomic physics was revolutionized by the development of forced evaporative cooling, which led directly to the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum-degenerate Fermi gases and ultracold optical lattice simulations of condensed-matter phenomena. More recently, substantial progress has been made in the production of cold molecular gases. Their permanent electric dipole moment is expected to generate systems with varied and controllable phases, dynamics and chemistry. However, although advances have been made in both direct cooling and cold-association techniques, evaporative cooling has not been achieved so far. This is due to unfavourable ratios of elastic to inelastic scattering and impractically slow thermalization rates in the available trapped species. Here we report the observation of microwave-forced evaporative cooling of neutral hydroxyl (OH(•)) molecules loaded from a Stark-decelerated beam into an extremely high-gradient magnetic quadrupole trap. We demonstrate cooling by at least one order of magnitude in temperature, and a corresponding increase in phase-space density by three orders of magnitude, limited only by the low-temperature sensitivity of our spectroscopic thermometry technique. With evaporative cooling and a sufficiently large initial population, much colder temperatures are possible; even a quantum-degenerate gas of this dipolar radical (or anything else it can sympathetically cool) may be within reach.},

The collision rate is measured over a range of electric fields from 0.2 to 10 kV/cm.

The observed inelastic collision rate follows an approximate quadratic power law in the effective dipole moment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Cold and ultracold polar molecules with nonzero electronic angular momentum are of great interest for studies in quantum chemistry and control, investigations of novel quantum systems, and precision measurement. However, in mixed electric and magnetic fields, these molecules are generically subject to a large set of avoided crossings among their Zeeman sublevels; in magnetic traps, these crossings lead to distorted potentials and trap loss from electric bias fields. We have characterized these crossings in OH by microwave-transferring trapped OH molecules from the upper |f; M = +3/2{\textgreater} parity state to the lower |e; +3/2{\textgreater} state and observing their trap dynamics under an applied electric bias field. Our observations are very well described by a simple Landau-Zener model, yielding insight to the rich spectra and dynamics of polar radicals in mixed external fields.},

@article{Zeppenfeld2012,
abstract = {Polar molecules have a rich internal structure and long-range dipole-dipole interactions, making them useful for quantum-controlled applications and fundamental investigations. Their potential fully unfolds at ultracold temperatures, where various effects are predicted in many-body physics, quantum information science, ultracold chemistry and physics beyond the standard model. Whereas a wide range of methods to produce cold molecular ensembles have been developed, the cooling of polyatomic molecules (that is, with three or more atoms) to ultracold temperatures has seemed intractable. Here we report the experimental realization of optoelectrical cooling, a recently proposed cooling and accumulation method for polar molecules. Its key attribute is the removal of a large fraction of a molecule's kinetic energy in each cycle of the cooling sequence via a Sisyphus effect, allowing cooling with only a few repetitions of the dissipative decay process. We demonstrate the potential of optoelectrical cooling by reducing the temperature of about one million CH(3)F molecules by a factor of 13.5, with the phase-space density increased by a factor of 29 (or a factor of 70 discounting trap losses). In contrast to other cooling mechanisms, our scheme proceeds in a trap, cools in all three dimensions and should work for a large variety of polar molecules. With no fundamental temperature limit anticipated down to the photon-recoil temperature in the nanokelvin range, we expect our method to be able to produce ultracold polyatomic molecules. The low temperatures, large molecule numbers and long trapping times of up to 27 seconds should allow an interaction-dominated regime to be attained, enabling collision studies and investigation of evaporative cooling towards a Bose-Einstein condensate of polyatomic molecules.},
